Single Sign-On (SSO) in ToolJet simplifies user authentication by allowing access to the platform through a single set of credentials. ToolJet supports various SSO providers, including **GitHub**, **Google**, **OpenID Connect**, **LDAP**, and **SAML**, ensuring compatibility with diverse organizational requirements.

## Group Sync

Group Sync in ToolJet enables automatic synchronization of user groups from external identity providers like **OIDC**, **LDAP**, and **SAML**. This feature allows for seamless management of user groups across platforms, ensuring consistency between ToolJet and external systems. By syncing groups, administrators can efficiently control access and permissions based on predefined user roles and organizational structures, streamlining user management while maintaining security and efficiency.
