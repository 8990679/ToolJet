title: Whitelist CDN Domains
---

ToolJet allows importing external libraries via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) or [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/). If you need to load resources from other CDN URLs, you must whitelist them.

To do this, set the CSP_WHITELISTED_DOMAINS environment variable with your custom CDN domains. Once configured, ToolJet automatically updates the Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to include the approved CDN URLsâ€”no server restarts required. This ensures secure loading of external libraries while maintaining CSP compliance.

| Variable | Description                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CSP_WHITELISTED_DOMAINS | CDN domains ( eg: cdn.example.com, assets.mycompany.com, static.customcdn.net) |
