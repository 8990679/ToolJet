The ToolJet Dashboard is the initial landing page that you see upon logging into your workspace. This interface serves as a central hub where you can access a variety of features. Primarily, it displays all the applications you've created within ToolJet. Moreover, you have the capability to create new workspaces and applications directly from this dashboard. Additionally, it provides an option to create folders for categorizing and managing applications for easier organization, access control, and workflow management.

Furthermore, the dashboard serves as a gateway to various essential sections, such as **[Workflows](/docs/workflows/overview)**, **[ToolJet Database](/docs/tooljet-db/tooljet-database/)**, **[Data Sources](/docs/data-sources/overview)**, **[Marketplace](/docs/marketplace/marketplace-overview)**, **[Workspace Settings](/docs/tutorial/manage-users-groups)**, **[Settings](/docs/enterprise/superadmin/#settings)**, and **[Audit logs](/docs/enterprise/audit_logs/)**. You can effortlessly navigate to these sections directly from the dashboard.
