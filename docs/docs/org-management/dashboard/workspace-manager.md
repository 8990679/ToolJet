The workspace manager is located on the bottom left corner of the dashboard. Clicking on the workspace manager will open a dropdown menu listing all the workspaces you belong to. You can switch between workspaces by clicking on the workspace name from the dropdown menu.

## Add New Workspace

On clicking the **+ Add new workspace** button, a modal will open where you can enter the name of the workspace, enter the unique workspace slug, and can see the preview of the workspace URL. Click on the **+ Create Workspace** button to create a new workspace.

Previously, the workspace slug was an automatically generated workspace ID, like this: *262750db-b2b8-4abb-9404-8995c2ecb2a0*. Now, you can set a custom, unique slug for your workspace which will generate a more accessible or readable URL such as *tooljet-workspace*.

#### Conditions for workspace slug

- The workspace slug should be unique.
- The workspace slug should not contain any special characters except **-**.
- The workspace slug should not contain any spaces.
- The workspace slug should not contain any capital letters.
- The workspace slug should not be empty.
