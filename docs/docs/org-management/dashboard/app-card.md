The dashboard displays all the apps created in the workspace as cards. These cards are displayed in a grid layout. The app cards display the **name of the app**, the **name of the creator**, and the **date of creation**. The app cards also display the app **icon**, which can be changed by clicking on the `Change Icon` option from the app menu.
