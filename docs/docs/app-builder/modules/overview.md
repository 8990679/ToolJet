Modules in ToolJet are reusable units of functionality, made up of components, queries, actions, and logic, that you can use across multiple apps in the same workspace. Think of a module as a mini-app that can be plugged into other ToolJet apps.

They help you, reduce duplication of logic/UI across apps, maintain consistency in common features, build faster, especially for repetitive patterns like forms, charts, input flows, or table views.

## When to Use Modules

Use modules when:

- You want to reuse a feature like a user registration form or an analytics widget across multiple apps.
- Youâ€™re building template components for your team to standardize.
- You need to abstract complex logic behind a simple interface for other users.

Unlike copying/pasting UI blocks or duplicating pages, modules provide centralized, configurable, and reusable blocks that can adapt to context via inputs and outputs.
