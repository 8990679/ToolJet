ToolJet's app-builder lets you build apps in minutes using few key building blocks – UI Components, Data Sources and Queries, Events, and Custom Code​.

These building blocks work together to let developers, product managers, and enterprise teams build powerful apps with ease. 

## Building the Interface

ToolJet offers a rich library of pre-built components – from basic inputs and buttons to tables, charts, and forms – that you can simply drag and drop onto the canvas. Laying out an interface is intuitive: you place components visually, resize and reposition them, and configure their properties through an easy-to-use Properties Panel, all without writing any code​.

</div>

By default, components come with sensible styling and can be customized (text, colors, visibility, etc.) through the properties panel. Components are highly dynamic and can respond to your app’s data or state. 

## Connecting Your Data

You can interact with your data sources through Queries. A query in ToolJet is a defined action that fetches, filters, or modifies data from a data source (for example, an SQL query, a REST API call, or even a Google Sheets operation). Queries act as the bridge between your UI and your back-end data​.

</div>

They can retrieve data to display in components or send user input back to your database, making the app truly functional and data-driven​. Creating queries is developer-friendly: ToolJet provides a Query Panel where you can construct queries either via a form-based interface or by writing the code/SQL yourself​.

## Making Apps Interactive

Events in ToolJet define the interactive logic of your application – how the app responds when users do something or when certain conditions are met. ToolJet provides a declarative way to handle events through its Event Handlers configuration, so you can create complex behaviors without writing boilerplate code.

</div>

There are many trigger points for events: a user clicking a button or submitting a form, a page loading, a query finishing its execution, etc. When an event is triggered, ToolJet can carry out actions in response (ToolJet actions include things like running a query, opening a modal, showing a notification, navigating to another page, etc.). You can chain events and actions to orchestrate multi-step flows.

## Handling Complex Logic

While ToolJet makes it easy to build applications without writing code, it also gives developers full power to extend app functionality with custom logic. Using Run JavaScript queries, you can write code directly within the platform to perform calculations, transform data, trigger other queries, or manipulate UI components. These snippets have full access to the app’s state and context, allowing advanced use cases like conditional behaviour, data processing, or dynamic UI updates.

For even more flexibility, ToolJet supports Python scripting. This is especially powerful for teams already using Python for business logic or data processing. 


ToolJet users can build fully-featured internal dashboards, admin panels, forms, and other business applications fast – without sacrificing the flexibility to handle complex scenarios. This makes ToolJet an ideal choice for teams looking to accelerate development and deliver high-quality internal tools that meet their exact needs.
